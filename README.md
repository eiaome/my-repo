Hello, My name is Eurika! I love learning new things hence I am here in this bootcamp. I must admit, this is way more fun than solving Chemistry and Biology problems. Now, I know that there are other codes than A,T,C, G, and other pathways than biochemical pathways. Cool realization, all biochemical pathways are also based on "codes", without codes there's no metabolic pathways, no metabolic pathways, no LIFE. :D
